- After that, run `npm start` in the terminal. This will launch a local server and open the website in your browser. You can make changes to the code and see them reflected on the website.

- Now, you can understand the code structure and implement new features, suggest improvements, or fix bugs. Make sure to follow the coding style and conventions of the project.

- When you are done with your changes, commit your work using `git commit -m “<message>”` where `<message>` is a brief description of what you did.

- Finally, open a pull request on GitHub. This will send your changes to the maintainer of the original repository for review. The maintainer will check your code and accept or reject your pull request.
